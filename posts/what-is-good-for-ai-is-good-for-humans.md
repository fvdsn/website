title: What Is Good For AIs Is Good For Humans

I have discovered something marvelous; whatever you do
to make the AIs more effective at helping you do your job
is also going to help your fellow human colleagues. 

Let me take an example; comments in code. I have been guilty of
never putting much comments in my code. The reason being that
I didn't need them (I wrote the code, I know what it does), and
that they're a pain in the ass to maintain. 

But what I have found is that comments of the useful kind, the
ones that give context, the ones that take actual thinking to write,
are very helpful for the AI. And so making good comments is now
helping me directly each time I use the AI. But they're also very
useful for my colleagues !

And that pattern repeats on many aspects; I like long files, I find
them easy to navigate with vim, my colleagues don't. I thought they
needed better editors. But the AI doesn't like these either, so now
I split my code in smaller files, for me and my colleague's benefit.

Other colleagues also had their own brand of annoying behaviour, but
now it's not just me having crazy ideas or skill issues, I can just 
point to the bad impact on the AI, which by miracle seems to have
good taste and a liking for common sense practices

Unit tests, readable code, modularity, documentation, all the parts
we sometimes avoid to do out of selfishness or a mistaken sense of 
urgency now have an immediate and objective negative impact, and
the hard work of fixing all that is also made easier with the AI,
it's a positive feedback loop !

And this doesn't stop at code. One thing I never really liked is
writing detailed specifications for tickets. Shouldn't developpers
know what the application is doing, and think for themselves of
what it should ? Yes and no, in reality if I knew better, I should
have put that in the ticket, the developper could have used that
help. The AI certainly needs it for good results. All the prep
work I now need to do to get good AI results is actually what I 
should have been doing the whole time. And the AI can help me do
that better as well.

But then, if the AI can now execute on my excellent tickets, do I
still need colleagues ? I actually need them more than before,
thanks to AI there's a lot more use cases for my app, new possibilities, 
more work than I can handle, and my colleagues can now do it better with
AI as well.
