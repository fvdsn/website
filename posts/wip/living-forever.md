# Living Forever

Cancer is cured. Heart disease ? That too. Getting old ? Not anymore.
Germs ? Eradicated ! It's the future ! Science has won ! Humans now live forever ! 

But how long is forever ? On average 250 Years. Science can cure cancer, but can't cure accidents, wars and natural disasters. And I crunched the numbers, if you exclude old age and diseases, you'll live up to 250 years. Not bad, but not an eternity either. If this makes you sad you can consider uploading yourself to the cloud and we'll see how long it will take for your e-clone to die encrypted by some bitcoin ransomware.
