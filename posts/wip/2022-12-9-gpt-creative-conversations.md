ChatGPT has an uncanny ability to expand a few bullet points into a much more fleshed out piece of work.  Unsurprisingly, those generally lack depth and have quite a few errors. 

But there's an easy fix, instead of retrying with a different prompt, just ask ChatGPT to correct the mistakes, or make any kind of modifications that you want. You can give it very general guidance, or be very precise, it works like magic! 

I think it's easier to explain by just showing you some examples, today we'll look at programming but also storytelling, we'll write a chapter for a light novel.

### Let's try it with programming

We'll create a small program that makes a request and retries it if it fails.  We could give it a very complex prompt that fully specifies everything we desire, but instead we'll start with something simple, and evolve it step by step.

I think you get the idea! Here I made quite small and local modifications but you can also make more generic requests such as adding comments, fixing a bug by giving it the error, adding a forgotten `free()` (it will figure out where to put it), rewriting it in another language, etc, etc.

### Now let's write a story
