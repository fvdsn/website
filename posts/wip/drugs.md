# Drugs Solved All My Problems

I hate my job, don't have a family, not much friends either. I don't do sports, 
don't even walk, I take the car the rare times I go outside. All the light I get is
from the TV, or my smartphone, which I obsessively check every 5min hoping for the latest round of awful
news to be even worse than the previous.
I have no dreams, don't plan to, I don't go to church, don't really believe in anything, except
that the world is a fuck, maybe ? Not going to do much about it either, anyway, I don't cook, I get my food from
the mailman, which is really practical. Frozen pizza is also really practical, especially when I'm binge watching 
netflix at 4am on a sleepless night. Goes well with beer and cola. I live alone, pornhub is my girlfriend, I think I'll buy a cat.

Apart from that I have a few problems. I can't seem to focus at work so my career is kind of stuck. This is a really
big problem because I would like to have more money. I really like money, it brings me joy and happiness, also,
my eternal lack of money is the source of all my problems. For example, I am physically out of shape, I am fat and
weak, always sick, my breath smells and my back hurts, which prevents me from focusing at work. I wish I would look strong and cool
like a super hero, then I would have many friends and a hot wife and a mistress. She would have traditional values;
she would take care of my kids while I play videogames.

As you can see this is a tough situation to be in !

Fortunately all of these problems are easily solved with drugs ! I've tried it, It works and I'm really happy now !
So I'd like to share my tips with you, but in doubt, ask your doctor. The following list is not exhaustive, but it'sa good place to start:

- Rilatin to focus at work
- Steroids to get strong
- Xanax for anxiety 
- Alcohol and nicotine for socialising
- Cocaine for business
- LSD for spirituality
- Tirzepatide to lose weight
- Paracetamol for hangovers
- Vitamins for general health
- Prozac for general depression
- Ketamine to party
- Nivea cream for puffy eyelids
- Insulin for diabetes
- Weed to stop noticing my life is meaningless
- Modafinil to beat the grind
- Melatonin to sleep
- Cafeine to wakeup
- Ayahuasca to restart from scratch
- And Mushroom microdoses to top it all off

Now, drugs are good, but diet is important too. After reading a lot of papers I've concluded that the vegan diet is the best. 
Of course if like me you're alergic to gluten, then a keto diet might be an easier alternative.

That's all, I hope this was helpful for you, stay healthy my friend, your body is a temple. And as always; don't forget to like and subscribe.
