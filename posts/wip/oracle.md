# What do you ask to an omniscient oracle ?

```
    > I am the all knowing oracle. I know all about
    the past, present and future. I know what is true
    and wat is not. My reasoning is without flaw. My
    answers are concise and instant. What do you wish
    to know ?

You didn't expect it, but here it is, the all omniscient
oracle ! You can ask it anything, it will give a perfect answer. 
So what do you ask ? Take some time to think about it, but keep
in mind, you aren't the only one who can ask it questions.

In fact, a mathematician is already at it. "What are the solutions
to the top 100 unsolved mathematical problems". The oracle answers
without flaw. And then the mathematician wonders, "What should I ask next ? The next hundred ?"

Meanwhile a physicist asks, "What are the rules that govern the universe",
and he gets his answer ! But then he wonders, what to ask next ?

Then the physician asks, "What are the cures to all diseases ?" And the altruist,
"What is best for humanity"; the theologian, "Does God exists ?"; the artist,
"What is most beautiful ?"; The romantic, "Where to find true love ?";
the prankster, "What is the most believable falsehood ?";
the fool, "What should we not know ?"; the politician; "How do I rule the world ?"

So what do you ask ? 

Well, actually it doesn't really matter ! His answers are knowledge,
and knowledge, before all, must be remembered. All the oracle's answers, to matter, must
be remembered. In someone's head, in a book, in a picture, in stone, in a server somewhere,
they have to be remembered. Otherwise they will be gone ! useless ! forgotten ! dead ! the answers ... and the questions too !
And there isn't room for all of them; Knowledge is infinite, but memory is not ...
All of humanity's questions and all the oracle's answers, they will have to compete for rememberance. They will say to us; please talk about me,
please write me down, please share me, print me ! remember me ! And of those, only the winners.

So will we remember what's good and true ? What's beautiful ? What makes us rich ? What grants us power ? What's sad ? What's evil ? 
What we should ? what we shouldn't ?

Who knows ! Well...  the oracle knows, so better just ask it:

```
> What will we remember ?
```

And the answer is:

```
> nothing.
```

Alas, nothing lasts forever.
